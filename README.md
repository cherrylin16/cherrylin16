## Hello there, I'm Cherry!

#### I'm a student attending the University of Virginia, majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity in the School of Engineering & Applied Science. 

#### My current interests lie in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and Zero Trust architectures, while I also carry passions for front-end engineering and UI/UX. I aspire to empower marginalized communities in STEM, innovate solutions that serve the public good, and make a positive impact.

## Beyond my technical interests, I spend my free time:
* Reading diverse genres (most recently read "Pyschology of Money" by Morgan Housel)
* Painting landscapes and expressing creativity through hands-on art projects
* Spending time with my family and Maltese puppy, Tofu

#### I'm always interested in internship opportunities, fellowships, and collaborative work. Please feel free to reach out at:

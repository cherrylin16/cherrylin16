## Hello there, I'm Cherry! ⭐

##### I'm a student attending the University of Virginia, majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity in the School of Engineering & Applied Science. 

##### My current interests lie in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and Zero Trust architectures, while I also carry passions for front-end engineering and UI/UX. I aspire to empower marginalized communities in STEM, innovate solutions that serve the public good, and make a positive impact. 🌎☁️🔐

### Beyond my technical interests, I spend my free time:
* Reading diverse genres (most recently read "Pyschology of Money" by Morgan Housel) 📚
* Painting landscapes and expressing creativity through hands-on art projects 🎨
* Spending time with my family and Maltese puppy, Tofu 🐕

##### I'm always interested in internship opportunities, fellowships, and collaborative work. Please feel free to reach me at:
